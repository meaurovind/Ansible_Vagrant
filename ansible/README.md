## prerequisites
- CentOS/7
- Latest version of [Docker CE for CentOS](https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/docker-ce/centos/) _(container will be used to test and run Ansible roles)_

## Clone this repo
This alias is only required if git is not already installed on your machine. This alias will allow you to clone the repo using a git docker container
- `alias git='docker run -it --rm --name git -v $PWD:/git -w /git alpine/git'`
- `git version`
- `git clone https://github.com/shazChaudhry/Equal_Experts_tech_test.git`
- `sudo chown -R $USER:$USER Equal_Experts_tech_test`

## Jenkins server setup
- `cd Equal_Experts_tech_test`
- 

## Running individual Molecule commands
You will need to update relevant files under molecule directory and then execute the role inside a docker container as follows _(install-jenkins role is assumed here)_. You will also need to ensure that all existing container have stoped and removed: `docker container stop $(docker container ps -aq)`.
- lint - Executes yaml-lint, ansible-lint, and flake8, reporting failure if there are issues
- syntax - Verifies the role for syntax errors
- create - Creates an instance with the configured driver
- prepare - Configures instances with preparation playbooks
- converge - Executes playbooks targeting hosts
- idempotence - Executes a playbook twice and fails in case of changes in the second run (non-idempotent)
- verify - Execute server state verification tools (testinfra or goss)
- destroy - Destroys instances
- test - Executes all the previous steps
> The `login` command can be used to connect to provisioned servers for troubleshooting purposes

## Running all tests using Docker
You will need to update relevant files under molecule directory and then run the role inside a docker container as follows _(deploy-nginx role is assumed here)_. You will also need to ensure that all existing container have stoped and removed: `docker container stop $(docker container ps -aq)`
```
          docker run --rm -it \
          -v $PWD:/tmp/$(basename "${PWD}"):ro \
          -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \
          -w /tmp/$(basename "${PWD}") \
          quay.io/ansible/molecule:latest \
          sudo molecule test
```
